#summary Overview of the sMAP application protocol for accessing physical data.

= Introduction =

sMAP, the Simple Measurement and Actuation Profile is a simple specification for accessing data feeds from a variety of instruments using a JSON+HTTP -based protocol.  This google project hosts implementations of sMAP feeds for a variety of data sources using different backends.

Currently in use to expose data from the Cory Hall building monitoring project at UC Berkeley, live public feeds using this protocol are available to researchers through the http://www.openbms.org/smap/plot web interface.  

= Details =

To come soon -- the detailed sMAP specification.  The full Sensys '10 [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~stevedh/pubs/sensys10smap.pdf paper] and [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~stevedh/pubs/sensys10talk.pptx slides] are now available.
